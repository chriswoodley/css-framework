# Text Content

## Typographic Scale

See https://www.modularscale.com/?16&px&1.25]

All Text Content uses the base font size. The base font size is fluid. The table below illustrates
the minimum font size for the minimum screen width and the maximum font size for the maximum screen
width.

| Ratio | Min Base Font Size | Max Base Font Size |  Min Screen Size | Max Screen Size |
| :---  | :---               | :---               |  :---            | :---            |
| 1.25  | 16px               | 20px               |  <= 667px        | >= 1920px



## Paragraphs

<Preview>
  <Story name="Paragraphs" height="200px">
    {
      `
      <p>Separating paragraphs with blank lines is easiest for readers to scan, but they can also
        be separated by indenting their first lines. This is often used to take up less space, such
        as to save paper in print.</p>
      <p>Writing that is intended to be edited, such as school papers and rough drafts, uses both
        blank lines and indentation for separation. In finished works, combining both is considered
        redundant and amateurish.</p>
      <p>In very old writing, paragraphs were separated with a special character: ¶, the
        <i>pilcrow</i>. Nowadays, this is considered claustrophobic and hard to read.</p>

        <p>Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low altitude service. The
          connection topology is limited to a single point-to-point path for each carrier, used
          with standard carriers, but many carriers can be used without significant interference
          with each other, outside of early spring. This is because of the 3D ether space available
          to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3. The carriers have an
          intrinsic collision avoidance system, which increases availability.</p>
